If you have bug(fixe)s or implementation for missing features, awesome -- open
an issue or a PR.

If the OAuth server you are attempting to use employs one of the
[other grant types](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4), and you want
to add support to the client, we are definitely interested. We would like to
ensure that our code practices are maintained throughout this project, so drop
us a line at developers@imagineeasy.com so we can chart the best route to
incorporating your work.
