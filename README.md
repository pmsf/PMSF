# PMSF---PokeMap-Standalone-Frontend

This is the manual raid posting branch I put together a while back and only supports Hydro's Scanner.

> Current Version 1.0 - First release!

PokeMap Standalone Frontend or PMSF for short is a PHP Map Interface for the Monocle Scanner designed to be completely standalone and able to run on any traditional web server

It supports all the common database engines, including MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MsSQL, SQLite

## Get Started
Go to our [Wiki](https://github.com/Glennmen/PMSF/wiki) for more info about installation.

## Webhooks
Our fork does convert started raids into new raids with questionmark eggs. A special crafted spritesheet is used and you need to make a small change to the json files for PokeAlarm, PoracleJS or other messages filter relays.
